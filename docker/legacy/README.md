# Confluentinc image based docker setup (legacy)

Files in this directory are used by Dockerfile-legacy to build a legacy docker images (Confluentinc-based) of the connectors, 
as opposed to the new Strimzi based images.

The legacy setup can be to run the Kafka stack (Kafka, Zookeeper, Schema Registry and Kafka Connectors)
with docker compose (see [docker-compose.yml](../../docker-compose.yml)).
